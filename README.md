# rollup-plugin-svelte-inline

A plugin that enables you to write simple components in the script part of your .svelte file. Also it allowes you to use React-like conditions and array mappings instead of #if and #each directives. 

## Get started

Currently the code is quite "hacky", so it is not published to npm. So clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/micha-lmxt/rollup-plugin-svelte-inline
```
